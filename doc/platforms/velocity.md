## PermissionsEx for Velocity 

PermissionsEx requires Velocity 1.1.0 or newer.

* All commands have an extra `/` prefix to be run on the proxy, and output gold text to distinguish them from commands running on the server.

  For example, `/pex` will become `//pex` to work with the proxy's instance of the plugin.

* All subjects, when queried on the proxy, are in the `proxy=true` context
